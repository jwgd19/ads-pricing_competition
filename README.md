# ads-pricing_competition
### Part 1
 - Take in known customers' willingness to pay and focus on price pricing competition against other teams to maximize the total revenue after competing with 20 other groups.
 - Use machine learning approach(sklearn-linear-regression) to consider opponent's pricing preferences and try to cut them to win every round
 - Set a lower bound to avoid cut throat competition, which might significantly lower the revenue. Here we intentionally lose certain rounds to lure opponents to offer higher prices to maximize revenue
  - Instead of beating every single opponent, we intend to obtain the highest overall revenue after competing with 20 other groups individually


### Part 2
 - Take in customer covariates to predict their willingness to pay
 - Decide the optimal price to maximize revenue
 - Implement strategy in Part 1 to win the competition against other groups
